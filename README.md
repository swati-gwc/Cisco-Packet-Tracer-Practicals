# Cisco Packet Tracer Practicals

### About Packet Tracer: </br>
Packet Tracer is an important tool because it is an essential part of preparing for networking exams like the CCNA. Cisco certifications like the CCNA require candidates to complete practice labs, virtual environments that imitate a live networking environment.</br>

Tools like Packet tracer are used for practice labs and help students to take their book learning and apply it to a real-time environment. Being able to design networks with topology elements like nodes, routers and cables teaches the user how networks are made.</br>

### Purpose of this repository: </br>
It contains the lab experiments performed on Cisco Packet Tracer.</br> You can download these .pkt files and run them on cisco packet tracer on your laptop/desktop and play around with the network topology, designs, etc that has already been created.

### Want to Contribute?</br>
Feel free to make a PR to this repository and help everyone around who want to learn packet tracer.
